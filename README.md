# Speech-Recognition-
A simple speech recognition project.

GOAL


To extract the speech from any video.

Speech recognition helps us to save time by speaking instead of typing. It also gives us the power to communicate with our devices without even writing one line of code. This makes technological devices more accessible and easier to use. Speech recognition is a great example of using machine learning in the real life.
